## CORS error

Reacting to this special request, the server sends back a response header. This header contains an Access-Control-Allow-Origin key, to specify which origins can access the serverâ€™s resources. The key will have one of two values:

One: the server can be really strict, and specify that only one origin can access it:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
```

Two: the server can let the gates go wide open, and specify the wildcard value to allow all domains to access its resources:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```
